# JAVA SWING AND SQLITE DEMO

This is a simple and small desktop java application coded only in a few hours in 2017. The app has a java 
swing ui and a sqlite database junction, and was made for demonstration purposes only.

# FEATURES
- Loads (from sqlite db) and displays a list of items
- Adds and saves (to sqlite db) new items
- Updates and saves (to sqlite db) existing items
- Deletes (from sqlite db) existing items
- Sorts the item list

# KNOWN LIMITATIONS
- Missing dependency manager, right now all libs are added to the git repository
- db data file is also added to the repository (should be created if missing and not be added to the repository)
- Missing tests
