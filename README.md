# JAVA SWING AND SQLITE DEMO

This is a simple and small desktop java application coded only in a few hours. The app has a java 
swing ui and a sqlite database junction, and was made for demonstration purposes only.

# KNOWN LIMITATIONS
- Missing dependency manager, right now all libs are added to the git repository
- Text db file is also added to the repository (should be created if missing)
- Missing tests
- Probably more...
